# Optimized Seed-extension Stage for DNA Read Aligner

This project aims at enhancing the performance of the Smith Waterman (SW) and NeedlemanWunsch (NW) algorithm using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) extensions. SW [1]is used for local alignment between two sequences. On the other hand NW [2] can be used toperform global or semi-global alignment [2] between two sequences. Parasail library [5] is a suitethat provides SW and NW algorithms implemented in the various types of SIMD extensions.In particular, our project aims to use an existing SSE2 implementation of SW and extend itto: 1. implement SW using AVX2, and 2. implement NW using the SSE2 and AVX2 SMIDextensions. The purpose of these implementations is to use them as a seed extension stage ofGASE, a DNA read aligner developed in the CE laboratory.(https://github.com/nahmedraja/GASE).
